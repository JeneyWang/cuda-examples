# cuda-examples
Small programs to train using the CUDA APIs (part of the Heterogeneous Parallel Programming MOOC from University of Illinois)

Code stubs were provided by the [Heterogeneous Parallel Programming MOOC](https://www.coursera.org/course/hetero) teaching team.
Programs can be run even without local CUDA hardware thanks to the [WebGPU](http://webgpu.com/) companion tool, which provides an environment to run and test programs.
